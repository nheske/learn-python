# making-data-trees

This code makes a tree in anytree and then exports it to graphviz
* install [Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software](https://graphviz.org/download/) native library
* pip install graphviz
* pip install anytree

Note that since graphviz isn't explicitly imported, it didn't show up in my requirements.txt
* pip install pipreqs
* pipreqs /path/to/project
